**Overview:** 
Optimise the design of a residential micro electrical grid with varying numbers of electric vehicles (EV), using NSGA-II for grid design and Particle Swarm Optimization for EV charging/discharging. EV discharging provided energy back to the grid to support a high number of renewable energy sources in the grid. Built a multi-agent system that incorporated real geospatial data from a capital city's road map to evaluate solutions.

**Results:**
In grids where 50% of vehicles were electric, 60% of the electricity demand throughout a given day could be met by unused energy in EV batteries and the other 40% from renewable sources.
