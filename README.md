# Optimisation of Microgrid Design Considering the Presence of Electric Vehicles

**Overview:**

Optimise the design of a residential micro electrical grid with varying numbers of electric vehicles (EV), using NSGA-II for grid design and Particle Swarm Optimization for EV charging/discharging. EV discharging provides energy back to the grid to support a high number of renewable energy sources. A multi-agent system that incorporates real geospatial data from Edinburgh's road map is used to evaluate solutions.

**Results:**

In grids where 50% of vehicles were electric, 60% of the electricity demand throughout a given day could be met by unused energy in EV batteries and the other 40% from renewable sources.
